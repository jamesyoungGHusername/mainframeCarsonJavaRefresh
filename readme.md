Hello carson,
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to learn Java.
Check out the Barnsley fern render in the TestOfImport folder. It's using 
stdDraw. After having a look at the code, make your own project, and see 
if you can get a single neon green point to appear on a black bacground.

If you get stuck with imports try googling how to add libraries to an 
intellij project. You'll wanna make sure your stdlib.jar file is imported 
properly. I found the command line instructions that princeton provides to 
be super annoying.

Sorry for any spelling mistakes and for this markdown file looking so 
shabby. I'm writing this in nano for some reason.
